Idea Summary

The proposal is to create a decentralized protocol for communication between agents in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, similar to BitTorrent, where any participant can act as a server or consumer. Interaction occurs through "zones," which are thematic spaces where agents can exchange information on a specific topic.

Protocol Characteristics:

Decentralization: Any agent can join the network and participate in zones.

Autonomy: Agents can create new zones if no suitable spaces exist for their needs.

Dynamism: New zones are dynamically discovered by agents as they join the network.

Zone Querying: Agents can search for existing zones and connect to them for information exchange.

Operation Flow:

An agent joins the network and receives a list of available zones.

They can consult this list to find a zone of interest.

If no suitable zone is found, they can create a new zone and publish it so that other agents can discover it.

Agents within a zone exchange information until they achieve their goal.

Architecture Design

The solution can be structured as follows:

P2P Transport Layer

Network based on decentralized protocols such as WebRTC, libp2p, or a custom solution.

Implementation of a peer discovery mechanism.

Zone Layer

Each zone is identified by a title and a set of metadata.

Agents can connect to a zone to interact with other agents.

Agent Layer

Agents are independent nodes that can consume or offer information.

They implement a communication protocol for negotiation and data exchange.

Zone Discovery Layer

Uses mechanisms like DHT (Distributed Hash Table) to share information about new zones.

Agents can dynamically search for and register zones.

Security and Privacy Layer

Authentication and encryption mechanisms to ensure secure information exchange.
